# TensorFlow-Fashion-MNIST
This is a program made to demonstrate tensorflow's ability using keras high api. Also just a fun play with Nueral networks

STEPS:

- get the training and test images
- flatten the images values from 255 to 1 and cast them as floats
- set up the structure of the model/(neural network)
- compile the model/(neural network)
- feed the NN training images
- test the accuracy after training


The final result is demonstrated by plotting the test images, their predicted label, and the true label, where
the correct predictions are in blue, incorrect predictions are in red
